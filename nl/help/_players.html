		<h2>Terminology</h2>
		<h3 id="users">Users</h3>
		<p>
			Users are people who have installed and make use of the app.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="administrators">Ladder administrators</h3>
		<p>
			Ladder administrators are users who have either created their own ladder, or been given administrative
			privileges on a ladder by another ladder administrator.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="players">Players</h3>
		<p>
			Players are people who play against each other on at least one ladder.
			They can either play as individuals on a singles ladder, or as part of a team on a doubles/team ladder.
			Players can belong to more than one ladder, and to ladders of different types.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="teams">Teams</h3>
		<p>
			Teams are groups of players who play together in the same team on either a doubles or team ladder.
			They are represented on their ladders as a single competitor.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="competitors">Competitors</h3>
		<p>
			Competitors are players or teams that belong to ladders.
			They can have different display names and avatars on each ladder they belong to.
			Competitors don't necessarily have to be associated with users of the app,
			as ladder administrators or other players can capture results for competitors who don't use the app.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Singles competitors</strong><br>
				A competitor on a singles ladder can be associated with at most 1 player.
				If a competitor is linked to a player, the competitor will, by default, be displayed using the player's avatar.
				However, the competitor can be edited to use a different avatar.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Doubles competitors</strong><br>
				A competitor on a doubles ladder can be associated with up to 2 players.
				By default, competitors will be displayed using both their players' avatars,
				but they can be edited to use a single avatar for the competitor.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Team competitors</strong><br>
				A competitor on a team ladder can be associated with a limited number of players, depending on the size of the team.
				The maximum number of players on a team ladder can be up to double the number of players allowed in a team,
				to allow for reserves, or injured players.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="register">Registering a user</h2>
		<p>
			When users first use the app, they will need to 
			<a href="login.html#create">create/join a ladder and register themselves in the app</a>
			with their name, surname, email address and a password.
			They can also optionally add an avatar to identify themselves on ladders they belong to.
			<strong>This is highly advisable.</strong>
		</p>

		<h2 id="update">Updating player details</h2>
		<p>
			After login in to the app, players can edit their own details (name, email, password, avatar).
			The player who created the ladder will automatically become the ladder administrator. 
			This player can <a href="ladder-admin.html#set-player-admin">set other players to also be ladder administrators</a>
			on their ladders.
			<strong>It is advisable that more than one player is configured to be a ladder administrator.</strong>
		</p>

		<h2 id="add">Adding competitors</h2>
		<p>
			Ladder administrators can <a href="ladder-admin.html#manually-add-competitors">pre-load competitors</a>
			(individual players or teams) on their ladder and then invite players using the unique competitor codes
			that are generated for the competitors.
			After downloading the app, players will be able to join the ladder by entering the unique competitor codes.
			2 players can belong to the same competitor on doubles ladders.
		</p>
		<p>
			Competitors who have been added to the ladder by administrators can update their own details (display name,
			avatar) after they have logged into the app.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a player joins a doubles ladder, they will be able to share their competitor code with their partner.
			When their partner joins the app using the competitor code, they will automatically be associated with
			the competitor.
			Only 2 players can belong to a doubles team.
