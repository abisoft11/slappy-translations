			Slappy is free to use, but does come with some features that are only available to basic, premium or club subscribers.
			You have been given 30 days to try the premium features, after which you can choose to subscribe to either the
			basic, premium or club edition, or continue to use the free features.

			The basic edition has the following benefits:
		</p>
		<ul>
