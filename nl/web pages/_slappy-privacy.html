	<h1>Slappy privacy policy</h1>
	<p>
		When you use apps, you trust the developer with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what
		data is collected by abisoft, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time
		to read it carefully.
	</p>

	<h2>Personal information</h2>
	<p>
		Personal information includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, and similar data.
		Slappy records and makes use of your email address to log into the app and may send email messages related to the app (for
		example, to recover a forgotten password, or to send you reports). Your password is securely encrypted with a one-way encryption
		and stored in our database. This means that it is not accessible to anyone, including our developers.
	</p>

	<h2>Device information</h2>
	<p>
		Device information includes your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information,
		and similar data. Slappy stores your device information on a third party server in order to send push notifications to
		your device.
	</p>

	<h2>Log information</h2>
	<p>
		Currently abisoft does not capture logs from any apps. However, in the event of an app crash, you may be prompted to send
		the OS logs to the app distributor. These logs include information about the state of the app at the time of the crash
		and may be used by abisoft to improve the stability of our apps.
