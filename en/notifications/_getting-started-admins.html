	  <h1>Getting started</h1>
	  <h3>For administrators</h3>
      <p>
		Thank you for trying the Palappy Padel Ladder App.
		By creating a new ladder, you have automatically been assigned the role of "ladder administrator".
		As an administrator you can manage ladder settings and competitors.
      </p>
	  <h2>Step 1: Configure ladder settings</h2>
	  <p>
		When you create a ladder, you must configure the following settings for the ladder:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Name: Publicly visible ladder name. Must be unique for your region.</li>
		<li>Ladder image: Shown on the title bar and when players search for ladders.</li>
	    <li>Country: The country in which the ladder is hosted.</li>
	    <li>Region: The region in which the ladder is hosted.</li>
	    <li>Club name: Optional name of club where ladder is hosted.</li>
		<li>Ladder type: Singles, doubles or mixed doubles.</li>
		<li>Ranking type: The system used to rank competitors on the ladder.</li>
	    <li>
			Private/public: Players can only join a private ladder if they have the ladder code or a competitor code.
			Players can join public ladders without any codes.
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		You can edit the ladder settings at any time, by going to the app's main menu and switching to "Admin" mode.
		Then select "Ladder Settings" to edit the ladder settings.

	  <h2>Step 2: Adding players</h2>
	  <p>
		If the ladder is configured to be public, new players can join the ladder after searching for it by region. 
		If the ladder is private, they will need to join the ladder using the ladder code, which can be found in the
		ladder settings.
		Administrators can also add competitors manually which will create competitor codes that can be shared with
		players.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Sharing the ladder code</h3>
	  <p>
		You can find the ladder code in the ladder settings, by going to the app's main menu and switching to "Admin"
		mode. Then select "Ladder Settings" to view the ladder code.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		You can share this code with other players in any way you wish. The simplest is to press the "Share" button next to the ladder code, and sharing digitally using whatever method you prefer (Email, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, etc.). You could even create a flyer including the ladder code and put it up in your club.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Manually adding competitors</h3>
	  <p>
		<strong>This is particularly useful for adding competitors that don't have access to the app.</strong> Results can still be captured with competitors who don't have the app.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		To manually add competitors to the ladder, switch to "Admin" mode from the app's main menu and then press the "+" button on the ladders tab. Enter the competitor's display name and an optional avatar for the competitor.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		After adding a competitor you can share the ladder code by selecting "Add player" on the "Edit Competitor" page.
		You should only share this code with the players who should be associated with the competitor.

	  <h2>Step 3: Create ladder administrators</h2>
	  <p>
		<strong>It is strongly recommended to configure multiple administrators.</strong> Other administrators will be able to assist with administrative tasks in the event that you are not available.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Switch to "Admin" mode from the app's main menu, select a competitor on the ladder and select "Edit competitor"
		from the popup menu.
		Select a player in the list to set their admin status by switching the "Ladder Administrator" toggle on.

	  <h2>Step 4: Capture results</h2>
	  <p>
		As a ladder administrator, you can capture previous results, to start calculating competitor ranks.
		Switch to "Admin" mode from the app's main menu, select the "History" tab, and press the "+" button to add a
		result between 2 ladder competitors.
