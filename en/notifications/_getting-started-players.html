		<h1>Getting started</h1>
		<h3>For players</h3>
		<p>
			Thank you for trying the Slappy Sports Ladder App. The app can be used to send invitations and capture results,
			and will automatically calculate competitor ranks on the ladder, based on their results.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 1: Configure player profile</h2>
		<p>
			When you register as a user of the app, you need to create a player profile. This profile includes the following options:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Surname</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Profile picture:</strong> It is strongly advised to upload a profile picture, so that other players can easily recognize you on the ladder.</li>
			<li><strong>Email:</strong> Your email address is used when you log in to the app and also for recovering your password.</li>
			<li><strong>Password:</strong> You can change your password at any time.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			You can edit your player profile at any time, by going to the app's main menu and selecting &ldquo;Edit Profile&rdquo;.
		</p>

		<h2>Step 2: Find an opponent</h2>
		<p>
			Once the ladder has been functioning for a while, competitors will be sorted on the ladder, based on their 
			performance. You can view competitor details by selecting their profile picture from the ladder.
			View the competitor's rating points, past results, rating change graphs and your expected result, to find a
			suitable opponent.

		<h2>Step 3: Arrange games</h2>
		<p>
			You can use the app to arrange games with other competitors on your ladder.
			Select a competitor on the ladder and select &ldquo;Arrange game&rdquo;.
			Select the proposed date and time, and send the invitation.
			You can optionally send a message with your invitation.
			The competitor's player(s) will receive a notification of your invitation and will be able to respond to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>You can only send invitations to competitors who have used the app.</strong>
			Competitors without the app are greyed out on the ladder.

		<h2>Step 4: Capture results</h2>
		<p>
			After playing a game you can capture the result by selecting the competitor on the ladder and selecting &ldquo;Capture
			result&rdquo; from the popup menu.
			You can also capture results from the &ldquo;Invitations&rdquo; tab, if the game was arranged using the app.
			You can capture results even if your opponent doesn't yet have the app, as long as they have been added to the ladder by
			an administrator.
