		<h2>Deleting a ladder</h2>
		<p>
			There is currently no way to delete a ladder, however, as a ladder administrator, you can
			<a href="#remove-competitor">remove all competitors</a>
			from the ladder and, finally, remove your own competitor.
			This will remove the ladder from all players' ladder menus.
			The ladder will still be listed if you search for it when trying to add a ladder,
			but will automatically be deleted completely at a later date.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Adding competitors</h2>
		<p>
			In admin mode, ladder administrators can add competitors to their ladders in several ways, depending on how they run the ladders.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Publicly accessible ladders:</strong><br>
					If a ladder is configured to be <a href="ladders.html#private">public</a>,
					players can join the ladder by searching for it in their region.
					Public ladders allow new players to find opponents in their area.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Sharing a ladder code:</strong><br>
					Whether a ladder is <a href="ladders.html#private">public or private</a>, administrators can
					<a href="#share-ladder-code">share the ladder code</a> to allow players to easily join the ladder.
					When players join a ladder using a shared ladder code, a new competitor will be created for each player that joins the ladder.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Sharing a competitor code:</strong><br>
					If ladder administrators would prefer to <a href="#manually-add-competitors">manually add competitors</a>
					to their ladder, they can do so, and then share the unique competitor codes for each competitor with individual players.
					For new players to be able to join the ladder, they will need to first get a competitor code from the administrator.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="share-ladder-code">Sharing a ladder code</h3>
		<p>
			Ladder administrators can view and share their ladder codes by switching to Admin mode and editing their ladder.
			They can then click on the share button next to the ladder code to share it via social media, email, etc. They can
			also display their ladder code at their local club, to allow club members to join the ladder.
		</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="img/ladder-admin/admin-share-ladder-code.png">
		
		<h3 id="manually-add-competitors">Manually adding competitors</h3>
		<p>
			Ladder administrators can manually add new competitors to their ladders by pressing the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button
			that is shown on the ladder tab in Admin mode.
			They will be prompted to enter the competitor's display name, and optionally add an avatar for the competitor.
			They can then share the newly created competitor's code with a player (or players for doubles/team ladders),
			to allow the player to join the ladder.
			To do this they can press the &ldquo;Add player&rdquo; option to share the code with the player/players to link to the competitor.
			To share the code at another time, they can select the competitor in the ladder (in admin mode) to edit the competitor,
			and share the competitor code as described above.
			After the maximum number of players have linked to the competitor, ladder administrators will no longer be able to share their codes.

		<h3 id="set-player-admin">Granting players administrative access</h3>

		<h2>Adding results</h2>
		<p>
			Ladder administrators can capture results for competitors who aren't linked to any app users, as well as for
			<a href="#tournament-results">tournament results</a>.
			Results that are captured by administrators don't need to be confirmed by the players.
			After capturing a result, a push notification will be sent to all players linked to the 2 competitors.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To capture a result of a match played between 2 competitors, switch to Admin mode and press the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button
			on the results tab. Select the first competitor from the list of ladder competitors that is presented.
			(For consistency, it is recommended to select the winner first, but this is not required)
			Then select the other competitor.
			Thereafter, you will be able to enter the date and time of the match, as well as the result.
			You can either enter the overall match result (e.g., 3 - 0), or the individual game scores (e.g., 15-8, 15-7, 16-14).
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="tournament-results">Tournament results</h3>
		<p>
			Tournament results are results that were played as part of an organized tournament.
			Only ladder administrators can capture tournament results.
			Tournament results are weighted more heavily than regular results, and will result in bigger changes to competitors' ranking points.
			To capture a tournament result, switch on the tournament result toggle switch.
