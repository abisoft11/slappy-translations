	  <h1>Slappy Player Management</h1>
	  <h2 id="players">Players</h2>
      <p>
        Players are uniquely identified on the Slappy system by their email address. After installing the app, players
		need to create their accounts and link them to the ladders to which they belong. They can either create a new
		ladder or join an existing ladder. They can do this by using the unique ladder code for the ladder, by
		searching for a ladder by country and region, or by using a unique <a href="#add">competitor code</a>. 
		Thereafter, they will need to enter their details on the Add Player page.
      </p>
	  
	  
	  <h2 id="competitors">Competitors</h2>
	  <p>
	    Competitors are players or teams that belong to ladders. If the ladder is for doubles, competitors can be
		associated with 2 players. By default, competitors will be displayed using their players' avatars, but they
		can be edited to use a different avatar for the competitor. Competitors can have different display names and
		avatars on each ladder they belong to.

	  <h2 id="register">Registering a player</h2>
	  <p>
	    When adding themselves to a ladder, players will need to enter their Name, Surname, Email address and a Password.
		They can also optionally add an avatar to identify themselves on the ladder. This is highly advisable.	
	  </p>

	  <h2 id="update">Updating player details</h2>
	  <p>
	    After login in to the app, players can edit their own details (name, email, password, avatar).
	    The player who created the ladder will automatically become the ladder administrator. This player can set other
		players to also be ladder administrators on their ladders.
		<strong>It is advisable that more than one player is configured to be a ladder administrator.</strong>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		To add other administrators, the administrator will need to switch to "Admin" mode from the main menu.
		In admin mode, they can select any competitor on the ladder and then select an associated player to change 
		their admin status.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Administrators can only edit competitor details (name and avatar), but can't edit player details.
	  </p>

	  <h2 id="add">Adding competitors</h2>
	  <p>
	    Ladder administrators can pre-load competitors (individual players or teams) on their ladder and then invite
		players using the unique competitor codes that are generated for the competitors. After downloading the app,
		players will be able to join the ladder by entering the unique competitor codes. 2 players can belong to the
		same competitor on doubles ladders.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Competitors who have been added to the ladder by administrators can update their own details (display name,
		avatar) after they have logged into the app.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		If a player joins a doubles ladder, they will be able to share their competitor code with their partner.
		When their partner joins the app using the competitor code, they will automatically be associated with
		the competitor. Only 2 players can belong to a doubles competitor.
