	  <h2 id="create">Joining a ladder</h2>
	  <h3 id="join-code">Using a code</h2>
	  <p>
		If a new player has received a ladder code or a competitor code, they can use it to join a ladder by pushing
		the "Create account/join ladder" button and then selecting "Enter ladder/competitor code". After entering their
		code, they can click the "Find code" button.
	  </p>

	  <h3 id="join-no-code">Without a code</h2>
	  <p>
		If a player would like to create a new ladder or join a ladder without a ladder code, they can do this by
		pushing the "Create account/join ladder" button and then selecting "Search/create ladder" button. They can then
		select their country and region to list all available ladders for their region. If the ladder they are looking
		for doesn't exist, they can press the "+" button to create a new ladder.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3 id="register-player">Registering a player</h3>
	  <p>
		After selecting or creating a ladder, the player must enter their name, surname, email address 
		and password, to join the ladder. Thereafter, they will be able to login to the app using the email address
		and password they have supplied.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		They can also optionally add an avatar that will be used to identify them on
		the ladder. <strong>Although adding an avatar is optional, it is highly recommended to provide a head and
		shoulders photograph, to be clearly identifiable especially to new players on the ladder.</strong>.
	  </p>

	  
	  <h2 id="login">Logging in</h2>
      <p>
		After a player has registered themselves, they can login to the app using their email address and password.
	  </p>

	  
	  <h2 id="remember">Remember password</h2>
	  <p>
		When logging in, players can choose to remember their password. If this option is selected, they will not need
		to log in again in future, unless they choose to log out from the main menu.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2 id="recover">Recover forgotten password</h2>
	  <p>
		If a player forgets their password, they can recover it by entering their email address and selecting the
		"Forgot password?" link. After confirming that they want to reset their password, they will be sent an email
		containing a verification code, which they can enter on the "Reset Password" page, to create a new password.
