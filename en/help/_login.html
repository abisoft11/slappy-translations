		<h2 id="create">Creating a user account</h2>
		<p>
			Before creating an account, new users must first <a href="#join-no-code">create a new ladder</a>
			or join an existing one.
			They can <a href="#join-code">join using a code</a> that they have received from their club or another ladder member,
			or by <a href="#join-no-code">searching for a public ladder</a> in their area.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="join-code">Using a code</h3>
		<p>
			If a new player has received a ladder code or a competitor code, they can use it to join a ladder by pushing
			the &ldquo;Create account/join ladder&rdquo; button and then selecting &ldquo;Enter ladder/competitor code&rdquo;.
			After entering their code, they can click the &ldquo;Submit code&rdquo; button.
			Thereafter, they can <a href="#register-user">complete the user registration process</a>.

		<h3 id="join-no-code">Creating a ladder or searching for a public ladder</h3>
		<p>
			If a player would like to create a new ladder or join a ladder without a ladder code, they can do this by
			pushing the &ldquo;Create account/join ladder&rdquo; button and then selecting &ldquo;Search/create ladder&rdquo; button.
			They can then select their country and region to list all available ladders for their region.
			If they find the ladder they are searching for, and it is public, they can join the ladder by selecting it.
			If they find the ladder, but it is marked as private,
			they will need to contact the club or other ladder members to request a code to join the ladder.
			If the ladder they are looking for doesn't exist, they can press the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button to 
			<a href="#create-ladder">create a new ladder</a>.
			If no ladders are found in a region, the player will automatically be prompted to create a new ladder.

		<p>
			If, after <a href="#join-no-code">searching for a ladder</a>, a user can't find it, 
			they can create a new ladder by pressing the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button.
			The user will need to enter a unique ladder name for their region, and optionally select
			an image for the ladder and their club name.

		<h3 id="register-user">Registering a user</h3>
		<p>
			After selecting a ladder to join, or creating a ladder, the user must enter their name, surname, email address 
			and password, to register themselves on the system.
			A competitor, linked to the ladder, will automatically be created for the player when they register.
			Thereafter, the user will be able to login to the app using the email address and password they have supplied.
		</p>
		<p>
			They can also optionally add an avatar that will be used to identify them on
			the ladder. <strong>Although adding an avatar is optional, it is highly recommended to provide a head and
			shoulders photograph, to be clearly identifiable, especially to new players on the ladder.</strong>.

		<h3 id="remember">Remember password</h3>
		<p>
			When logging in, players can choose to remember their password. If this option is selected, they will not need
			to log in again in future, unless they choose to log out from the main menu.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="recover">Recover forgotten password</h2>
		<p>
			If a player forgets their password, they can recover it by entering their email address and selecting the
			&ldquo;Forgot password?&rdquo; link. After confirming that they want to reset their password, they will be sent an email
			containing a verification code, which they can enter on the &ldquo;Reset Password&rdquo; page, to create a new password.
