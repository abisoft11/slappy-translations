		<h1>Slappy Results</h1>
		<p>
			After completing a match, results can be captured by any of the players involved in the match. Results should
			include the date and time that the match was started, and the number of games, points or sets that each
			competitor won in the match.		
		</p>
		<p>
			Players can either decide before their match, how many games will be required to win the match, or, if they are
			playing for a fixed amount of time, they can just enter all the completed games during their session. Using the
			second method, it is possible for a draw/tie result. Only the <a href="ranking.html#elo">ELO ranking system</a>
			allows for draws/ties. The <a href="ranking.html#leapfrog">Leapfrog ranking system</a> will not make changes
			to player rankings based on draws/ties.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="capture">Capturing results</h2>
		<p>
			Results can be captured in one of 3 ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>From an invitation:</strong> Any player involved in the game can touch the invitation in the
				<a href="tabs.html#invitations">Invitations tab</a> and select "Capture result". The time and date of the
				result will default to the time and date of the invitation, but this can be altered.
			</li>
			<img class="screenshot" src="img/invitations/invitation-details.png">
			<li>
				<strong>From the ladder:</strong> Even if no invitation was sent, a result can be captured by touching on the
				opponent in the <a href="tabs.html#ladder">Ladder tab</a> and selecting "Capture result".
			</li>
			<img class="screenshot" src="img/ladders/player-options.png">
			<li>
				<strong>By a ladder administrator:</strong> In admin mode, ladder administrators can capture results between
				ladder competitors, by clicking on the "+" button in the Results tab. Results added by administrators are
				automatically confirmed.
			</li>

			<img class="screenshot-3" src="img/results-admin/admin-edit-result.png">
		</ul>

		<p>
			The player or administrator capturing the result must enter the date and time of the match, and the number of games
			won by each competitor, in order to save the result. Once a result is captured by a player, the opponents have 2
			days to either confirm or dispute the result.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When capturing or editing results, users can either capture the overall result (e.g., 3 - 1)
			or the individual scores for each of the games or sets.
			To capture the individual scores, switch on the &ldquo;capture game scores&rdquo;
			(or similarly named) toggle switch and add as many individual scores as necessary
			by pressing the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button to add additional rows.
		</p>

		<h2 id="confirm">Confirming results</h2>
		<p>
			After a result is captured, the competitors' points won't be updated until the result is confirmed. Results can be
			confirmed in 1 of 2 ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Manually:</strong> An opponent can directly confirm the result in the <a href="tabs.html#results">
				Results tab</a> by pressing the confirm button (green tick), or by touching the result and pressing the "Confirm"
				button in the Result Details view.
			</li>
			<img class="screenshot" src="img/results/result-details.png">
			<li>
				<strong>Automatically:</strong> Results will be confirmed automatically after 1 hour, if the opponent is not
				yet using the app, or after 2 days, if the opponent is using the app, but doesn't manually confirm the result.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="dispute">Disputing results</h2>
		<p>
			A player can dispute a result if they don't agree with the scores, or date and time captured by their opponent.
			The player can directly dispute a result in the <a href="tabs.html#results">Results tab</a> by pressing the dispute
			button (red cross), or by touching the result and pressing the "Dispute" button in the Result Details view.
		</p>
		<p>
			When disputing a result, the player can modify the date, time and/or scores of the result that was captured by
			their opponent. This will effectively reject the captured result and send the new updated result to the opponent,
			who will in turn have 2 days to confirm or dispute the result.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="discard">Discarding or rejecting results<h2>
		<p>
			If players are unable to agree upon the actual result of the game, the result can be discarded/rejected
			by touching the result in the <a href="tabs.html#results">Results tab</a> and either pressing the "Discard" button
			(by the player who captured the result) or the "Reject" button (by the opponent) in the Result Details view.
