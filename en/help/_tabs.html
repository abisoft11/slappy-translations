		<h1>Slappy Tabs</h1>
		<p>
			The main view in Slappy Sports Ladder App contains 3 tabs (Ladder, Invitations and Results). On this page
			players can view their current rankings in their ladders, by selecting the Ladder tab. They can also view
			current/all invitations in the Invitations tab, or recent results in the Results tab.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="ladder">Ladder Tab</h2>
		<p>
			The Ladder tab lists all competitors in the currently active <a href="ladders.html">ladder</a>, in
			descending order (best competitor at the top).
			The <a href="ranking.html">ranking</a> is either determined by the competitors' points and their
			<a href="ranking.html#confidence">ranking confidence</a> (<a href="ranking.html#elo">ELO ranking</a>)
			or by their previous results (<a href="ranking.html#leapfrog">Leapfrog ranking</a>).
		</p>

			The colour of an item in the list is determined by the competitor's usage status:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>White:</strong> Competitors who have installed and used the app at least once.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Grey:</strong> Competitors who were added by a ladder administrator, but have never used the app.
			</li>
		</ul>

			The colour of a competitor's ranking is determined by their recent activity:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Blue:</strong> Competitors who have recorded at least one game in the last 30 days, and who have a
				<a href="ranking.html#confidence">ranking confidence</a> of at least 80%.

				<a href="ranking.html#confidence">ranking confidence</a> below 80%.
			</li>
		</ul>

			By touching a competitor's avatar, it is possible to view their details, including their
			<a href="ranking.html#confidence">ranking confidence</a>, your 
			<a href="ranking.html#expected">expected result</a> against the competitor and all possible
