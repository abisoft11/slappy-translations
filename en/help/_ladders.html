		<h1>Slappy Ladders</h1>
		<p>
			The Slappy Sports Ladder app is used to manage sports ladders. New ladders can be created when a new user is
			<a href="login.html#create">registering themselves</a>. The user creating the ladder will automatically
			become a ladder administrator for that ladder.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="joining">Creating or joining ladders</h2>
		<p>
			While <a href="login.html#create">registering a new user</a>, it is necessary for that user to join an
			existing ladder or to create a new ladder.
			After logging in to the app, users can create or join other ladders by touching their ladder icon and
			selecting the &ldquo;Add Ladder&rdquo; menu option.
			After selecting this option, the process is the same as the 
			<a href="login.html#create">initial process for creating or joining a ladder</a>.

		<h2 id="types">Ladder types</h2>

		<h2 id="types">Ranking type</h2>
		<p>
			The ranking type used to order competitors on the ladder must also be configured for new ladders. The ranking
			type can be one of the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong><a href="ranking.html#elo">ELO</a>:</strong> Points-based ranking system based on the chess ELO system
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong><a href="ranking.html#leapfrog">Leapfrog</a>:</strong> If the lower ranked competitor wins a match, they
				&ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; the higher ranked competitor on the ladder.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="multiple">Multiple ladders</h2>
		<p>
			Basic and premium subscribers can belong to multiple ladders. Touching the ladder icon will present a list of ladders
			that the player belongs to. Selecting a ladder from the list will show the selected ladder on the
			<a href="tabs.html#ladder">ladder tab</a>. It is also possible to view results for the selected ladder on the
			<a href="tabs.html#results">results tab</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Results are not linked to ladders.</strong> This means that you can belong to multiple ladders with
			some of the same competitors in both ladders. If you capture a result against an opponent that belongs to more than one
			of your ladders, the result will be captured for all of the shared ladders. The points change will most likely
			be different in each of the ladders.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="private">Public and private ladders</h2>
		<p>
			When creating or editing a ladder, it is possible to make them either public or private. Anyone can search for
			and join a public ladder, however, players can only join a private ladder if they have the ladder's code or a
			competitor code for the ladder.

			<a href="ladder-admin.html">ladder management tasks</a>.
