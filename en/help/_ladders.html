		<h1>Slappy Ladders</h1>
		<p>
		  The Slappy Sports Ladder app is used to manage sports ladders. New ladders can be created when a new player is
			being <a href="players.html#register">registered</a>. The player registering the ladder will automatically
			become a ladder administrator for that ladder.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="joining">Joining a ladder</h2>
		<p>
			When <a href="players.html#register">registering a new player</a>, it is necessary for that player to join an
			existing ladder or to create a new ladder. There are 3 ways to find an existing ladder:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Ladder code:</strong> If the player has been given an 8-digit code for the ladder, this can be
			entered to quickly find the ladder. Ladder codes can be sent/given to new players by ladder administrators
			or they could be displayed at the sports club where the ladder is hosted.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Competitor code:</strong> If the player has been given a 7-digit competitor code, this can be
			entered to quickly join the ladder with a preconfigured competitor. Competitor codes can be sent/given to new
			players by ladder administrators.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Location Search:</strong> New players can search for a ladder in their area, by first selecting their
			country and region, and then choosing from existing ladders in that region, by name.
		</li>

		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="adding">Adding a new ladder</h2>
		<p>
			If, after searching for a ladder, a player can't find their ladder, they can create a new ladder by
			pressing the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button. The player will need to enter a unique ladder name for their region, and optionally select
			an image for the ladder and their club name.
		</p>
		<p>
			If no ladders are found in a region, the player will automatically be prompted to add a new ladder.
		</p>
		<img class="screenshot" src="img/add-ladder.png">
		<p>
			After adding the ladder, the player must immediately <a href="players.html#register">register</a> themselves on
			the system, and they will become an administrator for that ladder. Thereafter, they can either add new competitors
			themselves, or share their ladder code with players who belong to the ladder.
		</p>

		<h3 id="types">Ladder types</h3>
		<p>
			When ladders are created, their type must be configured by the administrator. Ladder types are defined by the
			following options:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Sport:</strong> The sport that the ladder is used for. The following sports are currently supported:
			<ul>
				<li>Badminton</li>
				<li>Foosball</li>
				<li>Padel</li>
				<li>Racquetball</li>
				<li>Squash</li>
				<li>Table Tennis</li>
				<li>Tennis</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Format:</strong> The number of players for each competitor:
			<ul>
				<li>Singles</li>
				<li>Doubles</li>
				<li>Mixed Doubles</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<img class="screenshot" src="img/ladder-type.png">
		
		<h3 id="types">Ranking type</h3>
		<p>
			The ranking type used to order competitors on the ladder must also be configured for new ladders. The ranking
			type can be one of the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong><a href="ranking.html#elo">ELO</a>:</strong> Points-based ranking system based on the chess ELO system
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong><a href="ranking.html#leapfrog">Leapfrog</a>:</strong> If the lower ranked competitor wins a match, they
			&ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; the higher ranked competitor on the ladder.
		</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2 id="multiple">Multiple ladders</h2>
		<p>
			Basic and premium subscribers can belong to multiple ladders. Touching the ladder icon will present a list of ladders
			that the player belongs to. Selecting a ladder from the list will show the selected ladder on the
			<a href="tabs.html#ladder">ladders tab</a>. It is also possible to view results for the selected ladder on the
			<a href="tabs.html#results">results tab</a>.
		</p>
		<img class="screenshot" src="img/select-ladder.png">
		<p>
			<strong>Results are not linked to ladders.</strong> This means that you can belong to multiple ladders with
			some of the same competitors in both ladders. If you capture a result with an opponent that belongs to more than one
			of your ladders, the result will be captured for all of the shared ladders. The points change will most likely
			be different in each of the ladders.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="private">Public and private ladders</h2>
		<p>
			When creating or editing a ladder, it is possible to make them either public or private. Anyone can search for
			and join a public ladder, however, players can only join a private ladder if they have the ladder's code or a
			competitor code for the ladder.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="sharing">Sharing a ladder code</h2>
		<p>
			Ladder administrators can view and share their ladder codes by switching to Admin mode and editing their ladder.
			They can then click on the share button next to the ladder code to share it via social media, email, etc. They can
			also display their ladder code at their local club, to allow club members to join the ladder.
