	  <h1>Slappy Ranking</h1>
      <p>
		Slappy currently supports 2 ranking systems. Ladder administrators can select one of the following ranking
		systems for the ladder:
      </p>
	  <ul>
		<li><a href="#elo">ELO ranking</a> - recommended</li>
		<li><a href="#leapfrog">Leapfrog ranking</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h2 id="elo">ELO Ranking</h2>
      <p>
        The ELO ranking system used by Slappy is based on the ELO ranking system used in chess. Each competitor is allocated
		points based on their performance. Competitors with more points are ranked higher than competitors with less points,
		provided their ranking confidence is the same (<a href="#confidence">see below</a>).
	  </p>
	  <p>
		When a new competitor joins a ladder, they will be assigned 1500 points and based on the fact that they have not
		recorded any games, they will have a ranking confidence of 10%. After each recorded match, the competitor's points
		and ranking confidence will be adjusted, taking into consideration the following factors:
      </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>The competitor's points at the time of the match</li>
		<li>The opponent's points at the time of the match</li>
		<li>The number of games, points or sets the competitor won in the match</li>
		<li>The number of games, points or sets the opponent won in the match</li>
		<li>The opponent's ranking confidence at the time of the match</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h3 id="confidence">Ranking Confidence</h3>
	  <p>
	    A competitor's ranking confidence is calculated based on the number of games, points or sets they have recorded,
		and the number of different opponents they have played against, in the last 90 days.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		"Recorded games" are individual games in a match.  For example, if a competitor wins a match 3 - 2, this will count
		as 5 recorded games (or sets) for each competitor.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Ranking Confidence (%) = minimum(nGames/60, nOpponents/10) x 100, where:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>nGames = the number of games recorded in the last 90 days (up to a maximum of 60)</li>
		<li>nOpponents = the number of opponents played against in the last 90 days (up to a maximum of 10)</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h3 id="expected">Expected Result</h3>
	  <p>
	    Given the difference in points between 2 competitors, an expected result can be determined for a match between
		those 2 competitors. The expected result can be calculated as follows:
	  </p>
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Higher Ranked Competitor's Expected Games = Winner Games
	  </p>
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Lower Ranked Competitor's Expected Games = (100 - Points Difference) / 100 x Winner Games
	  </p>
	  <p>
		So, for example, if 2 competitors play a best of 5 games squash match (i.e., a competitor needs 3 games to win), and
		the difference between those competitors' points is 32:
	  </p>
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Higher Ranked Competitor's Expected Games = 3
	  </p>
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Lower Ranked Competitor's Expected Games = (100 - 32) / 100 x 3 = 2.04
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Hence, the expected result is that the higher ranked competitor wins 3 games to 2.04 games.  If this was the final
		score (which is obviously not possible since you can't have fractional games), then there would be no change in
		either competitor's points.  If the higher ranked competitor performs better than this (e.g., 3-0, 3-1 or 3-2), then
		that competitor's points will increase and the opponent's points will decrease.  If the higher ranked competitor
		performs worse than expected (e.g. 3-3, 2-3, 1-3 or 0-3), then that competitor's points will decrease and the
		opponent's points will increase.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The amount of change in points will grow proportionally, the further the actual result is away from the
		expected result. A competitor's points will also change more if the opponent's ranking confidence is higher.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3 id="calculation">Points Change Calculation</h3>
	  <p>
		Without going into too much detail, the basic idea of the points change calculation is that, based on the
		competitors' current points relative to each other, there is an expected outcome for the match. The competitor who
		performs better than expected will gain points, while the other competitor will lose points. Therefore, if a competitor
		wins a match by a smaller margin than expected, that competitor's points will decrease. <strong>Winning a match
		doesn't guarantee an increase in points</strong>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		When comparing competitors, it is possible to view the points changes for each possible result (premium version only). 
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3 id="ranking">Ladder ranking</h3>
	  <p>
		If a competitors has not recorded enough recent results, it is difficult to determine their true ranking. For this
		reason, their ranking confidence is used to adjust their points on <a href="tabs.html#ladder">the ladder</a>.
		These weighted (ladder) points are used to rank competitors on the ladder, instead of their unweighted points,
		which are used to calculate rating changes. Competitors are ranked in order of their ladder points, from
		highest to lowest.
	  </p>
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Ladder points = Unweighted Points - (100 - Ranking Confidence)
	  </p>
	  <p>
		For example, if a competitor has 1560 points, with a ranking confidence of 40%,
	  </p>
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Ladder points = 1560 - (100 - 40) = 1500
	  </p>
	  <p>
		If a competitor's ranking confidence is below 10% (i.e., they have not recorded any games in the last 90 days),
		their displayed points are further decreased by 2 points each day that they remain inactive.
	  </p>
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Ladder points = Unweighted Points - 90 - (Days Since Last Result - 90) x 2
	  </p>
	  <p>
		For example, if a competitor has 1560 points, but hasn't played in 120 days,
	  </p>
	  <p class="center-wrapper">
		Ladder points = 1560 - 90 - (120 - 90) x 2 = 1410
	  </p>
	  <p>
		<strong>Competitors who are not recording games will gradually move down on the ladder until they reach 0 points.</strong>
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2 id="leapfrog">Leapfrog Ranking</h2>
      <p>
        With the leapfrog ranking system, when a competitor joins a ladder, they are initially ranked at the bottom of the ladder.
		They can then challenge higher ranked competitors and, if they win, they will move above their opponent on the ladder, 
		shifting the opponent, and all competitors ranked between the 2 competitors, down 1 position on the ladder.
